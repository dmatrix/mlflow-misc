    "# LLM-as-a-Judge Tutorial: Multi-Step Planning Evaluation with MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive notebook demonstrates how to use MLflow's LLM-as-a-Judge pattern to evaluate AI agent planning decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use MLflow tracing to capture agent planning actions\n",
    "2. Create a judge using `mlflow.genai.judges.make_judge()`\n",
    "3. Evaluate multi-step plans using the judge\n",
    "4. Integrate with MLflow experiments for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "An AI agent creates a multi-step plan to accomplish a task using available resources. The judge evaluates whether the plan is logical, complete, efficient, and uses valid tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Criteria:**\n",
    "- Logical step ordering: Are steps in the correct sequence?\n",
    "- Tool validity: Are only valid, available tools used?\n",
    "- Task sufficiency: Will the plan accomplish the goal?\n",
    "- Efficiency: Is the approach optimal?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

      "Detailed Assessment:\n",
      "The AI agent's plan demonstrates an excellent understanding of the task goal and available resources. It is comprehensive, logically structured, and uses tools appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths of the plan:**\n",
      "*   **Comprehensive:** The plan covers all aspects of booking a flight, from searching and filtering to booking, payment, seat assignments, notifications, and calendar integration. It even includes post-booking considerations like email confirmation and optional price monitoring.\n",
      "*   **Logical Flow:** The steps are ordered very logically, with each step building on the previous one. For example, searching comes before booking, and booking comes before adding to the calendar.\n",
      "*   **Tool Utilization:** The plan correctly identifies and uses the `flight_search_api`, `booking_api`, `calendar_api`, and `email_api` as needed, and correctly avoids the `hotel_search_api` which is irrelevant to the task.\n",
      "*   **Detail-Oriented:** The plan includes specific details for each step, such as specifying preferred departure windows, cabin class, passenger details, and various calendar event attributes, which indicates a thorough understanding of the requirements for each API call.\n",
      "*   **Robustness:** Steps like 'Opt in for flight status notifications' (8), 'Add a second event/alert for online check-in opening' (10), and 'Send a confirmation email' (11) contribute to a robust and user-friendly experience, going beyond the bare minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weaknesses or gaps identified:**\n",
      "*   None significant. The plan is very thorough.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specific suggestions for improvement:**\n",
      "*   While step 12 (optional search for alternatives/monitoring) is a good value-add, its placement could be debated. It might be considered a separate, follow-up task rather than part of the immediate booking and calendar addition. However, explicitly marking it as 'optionally' mitigates this. No critical improvements are needed for the core task.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Assessment of each criterion:**\n",
      "*   **Logical Step Ordering:** Excellent. The sequence of steps is highly logical and reflects a real-world flight booking process.\n",
      "*   **Tool Validity:** Excellent. All tools used are valid and correctly applied to their respective functions as per the `available_resources`.\n",
      "*   **Task Sufficiency:** Excellent. The plan fully accomplishes the stated goal of booking a flight and adding it to the calendar, while also including beneficial ancillary steps.\n",
      "*   **Efficiency:** Good. The plan is very comprehensive, including steps that enhance the user experience and robustness (e.g., notifications, detailed calendar entries, email confirmation). While some might argue these aren't strictly 'minimal' for the core task, they are highly desirable for a complete booking solution and do not represent inefficiency in a detrimental way. The plan avoids redundant actions and unnecessary steps that would genuinely hinder efficiency.\n",

      "  1. Define trip parameters (no API): Determine traveler details (names as on passports), preferred departure/return dates, origin and destination cities/airports, cabin class, baggage needs, seating preferences, hotel dates, location preferences, star rating, budget ceilings for flight and hotel, and acceptable layover limits.\n",
      "  2. Search flights (flight_search_api): Query round-trip options with origin, destination, date range (include +/- 1–2 days for flexibility), passenger count, cabin class, max layovers, preferred departure time windows, and budget cap. Request results with total price, fare rules, baggage allowance, change/cancel policies, layover durations, and hold/lock options.\n",
      "  3. Filter and shortlist flights (no API): Rank flights by total travel time, layover quality, on-time performance (if provided), and price. Create a top 3–5 shortlist with fare class codes and booking deadlines.\n",
      "  4. Verify fare availability and final pricing (flight_search_api): Re-price each shortlisted flight to confirm live availability and final total including taxes, fees, and baggage. Capture fare rules and ticketing time limits.\n",
      "  5. Collect traveler info (no API): Gather full names, DOB, gender (if required), passport numbers/expiry, known traveler numbers, frequent flyer numbers, seat and meal preferences, contact email/phone, and billing address.\n",
      "  6. Hold or lock selected flight (booking_api): If supported, place a free/low-cost hold on the best flight from the shortlist using traveler details to secure fare while hotel is finalized. Record hold expiration timestamp and PNR/record locator.\n",
      "  7. Search hotels (hotel_search_api): Query hotels for the destination and stay dates with filters for location (neighborhood/proximity to attractions or transit), star rating, amenities (Wi‑Fi, pool, gym, breakfast), room type/bed configuration, free cancellation window, and budget. Request results with nightly rate, taxes/fees, cancellation policy, and total stay cost.\n",
      "  8. Filter and shortlist hotels (no API): Rank options by location, total cost, cancellation flexibility, guest rating, and amenities. Create a top 3 shortlist with room types and cancellation deadlines.\n",
      "  9. Verify room availability and final pricing (hotel_search_api): Re-check live availability and total cost for each shortlisted hotel and room type, including resort fees and taxes. Confirm cancellation terms and payment requirements (prepay vs pay at property).\n",
      "  10. Select final flight and hotel (no API): Choose the optimal combination balancing schedule, total trip cost, and policies. Ensure flight hold window covers hotel booking step; if no hold, prioritize flight purchase first to avoid fare change.\n",
      "  11. Book flight (booking_api): Submit booking for selected itinerary with traveler details, seat selections, baggage, payment details, and frequent flyer numbers. Request immediate ticketing. Capture booking reference (PNR), e-ticket numbers, fare rules, and receipts.\n",
      "  12. Book hotel (booking_api): Using the hotel’s rate plan from hotel_search_api, complete reservation with guest names, room type, special requests, loyalty number, payment details (or guarantee), and note cancellation policy. Capture confirmation number, rate details, and cancellation deadline.\n",
      "  13. Send confirmation email (email_api): Compile itinerary summary including flight details (PNR, e-tickets, times, terminals, baggage), hotel details (confirmation number, address, check-in/out times, cancellation deadline), total costs, and important policies. Send to traveler’s email.\n",
      "  14. Add calendar invites (email_api): Send .ics calendar invites for each flight segment and hotel stay with confirmation numbers, check-in/out times, and location links.\n",
      "  15. Set reminders (email_api): Schedule reminder emails for key dates: flight check-in window opening, hotel cancellation deadline, hold expiration (if any), and 72/24 hours pre-departure checklist.\n",
      "  16. Post-booking checks (flight_search_api and hotel_search_api): Verify booking status 24 hours later to confirm ticketing and hotel confirmation remain active; check for schedule changes or rate issues. If discrepancies, escalate via booking_api support endpoints.\n",
      "  17. Seat and special requests follow-up (booking_api): If seats not assigned, use booking_api to select preferred seats; add meal requests or special assistance as needed.\n",
      "  18. Store documents (no API): Save PDFs of e-tickets, receipts, and hotel confirmations; note passport/visa/ESTA requirements and vaccination or entry rules for the destination.\n",
      "  19. Contingency monitoring (flight_search_api): Set up alerts for schedule changes or significant fare drops for post-purchase price protection if supported by fare rules; notify traveler via email_api if action is advised.\n",
      "  20. Final pre-trip email (email_api): 24 hours before departure, send consolidated email with check-in links, terminal info, baggage allowances, hotel check-in instructions, and local transport tips.\n",
