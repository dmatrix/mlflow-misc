    "# MLflow Evaluation Demo: Multi-Turn Conversation with Session-Level Judges\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates MLflow 3.7's evaluation capabilities by showing how to:\n",

    "3. Extract and interpret evaluation results\n",

    "3. **`mlflow.genai.evaluate()`**\n",
    "   - Evaluates data (traces, DataFrames, etc.) with judges\n",
    "   - Returns evaluation results as DataFrame\n",
    "   - Handles both session-level and turn-level evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Session Tracking Pattern**\n",
    "   - `mlflow.update_current_trace(metadata={'mlflow.trace.session': session_id})`\n",
    "   - Tags each trace with session ID\n",
    "   - Enables multi-turn conversation evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Transparency**: See exactly how evaluation works  \n",
    "✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to customize judges and evaluation logic  \n",
    "✅ **Best Practices**: Direct MLflow API usage patterns  \n",
    "✅ **Reproducibility**: Copy cells to your own projects  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customize judge instructions in `prompts.py`\n",
    "2. Try different scenarios with `evaluate_custom_scenario()`\n",
    "3. Explore MLflow UI: `mlflow ui`\n",
    "4. Apply to your own conversational AI use cases"
