    "This notebook demonstrates **GEPA (Genetic-Pareto)**, an automatic prompt optimization algorithm integrated into MLflow via `mlflow.genai.optimize_prompts()`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**GEPA (Genetic-Pareto)** optimizes prompts through an iterative cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. EVALUATE  →  Run the prompt on training examples, score with a judge\n",
    "2. REFLECT   →  Use an LLM to analyze failures and propose improvements\n",
    "3. MUTATE    →  Generate improved prompt variations\n",
    "4. SELECT    →  Keep the best-performing candidates (Pareto-optimal)\n",
    "5. REPEAT    →  Continue until budget exhausted or convergence\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How **GEPA** automatically optimizes prompts through evaluate-reflect-mutate cycles\n",
    "2. Using `mlflow.genai.optimize_prompts()` with the **Prompt Registry**\n",
    "3. Preparing **training data** and a **predict function** for optimization\n",
    "4. Comparing **before/after** prompt quality with the `Correctness` scorer\n",
    "5. Optimized prompts are **automatically versioned** in the registry\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automate what you can**: GEPA systematically improves prompts that would take many manual iterations\n",
    "- **Data-driven optimization**: Training examples define what \"good\" looks like for the algorithm\n",
    "- **Registry integration**: Optimized prompts flow directly into the Prompt Registry for versioning and deployment\n",
    "- **Combine approaches**: Use GEPA for initial optimization, then fine-tune manually if needed\n",
