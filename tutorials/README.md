### 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

1. **Install UV** (if not already installed)
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
uv sync
```

3. **Configure API Keys**
Create a `.env` file in the tutorials directory:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000
```

4. **Start Jupyter**
```bash
uv run jupyter notebook
```

5. **Start MLflow UI** (in a separate terminal)
```bash
uv run mlflow ui --port 5000
```

6. **Open Browser**
Navigate to http://localhost:5000

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- OpenAI API key (or Databricks Workspace)
- Basic understanding of Python and LLMs

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of all tutorials, you will:

- ✅ Understand MLflow's core GenAI components
- ✅ Track and trace LLM experiments systematically
- ✅ Implement comprehensive tracing for observability
- ✅ Debug GenAI applications using trace visualizations and MLflow Assistant
- ✅ Manage prompts with version control and Prompt Registery
- ✅ Evaluate an agent using MLflow predefined judges, custom and integrated judges from DeepEval and RAGAS
- ✅ Build end-to-end RAG applications
- ✅ Build and evaluate multi-agent orchestration systems

### 💡 Tips

- Keep the MLflow UI open while working through notebooks
- Experiment with different parameter values
- Compare runs in the UI to understand trade-offs
- Tag runs for easy organization
- Track costs from the beginning

### ❓ Troubleshooting

**Issue**: MLflow UI won't start
```bash
# Try a different port
uv run mlflow ui --port 5001
```

**Issue**: API key not recognized
```python
# Restart Jupyter kernel after adding to .env
# Or set manually:
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-key"
```

**Issue**: Module not found
```bash
# Sync dependencies with UV
uv sync

# Or install specific package
uv add mlflow openai python-dotenv
```
